# How to Install and Run the Project

to mount the project you'll need a live server; you can use, for example:

```
npm i live-server -g
```

then run live server from the project directory:

```
live-server
```

if you get an error ("scripts disabled on this system"), you'll need to bypass execution policy:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\npm\live-server.ps1
```
